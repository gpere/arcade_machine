1tb? hard drive ON SALE:[link](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Portable-External-Drive-WDBUZG0010BBK-WESN/dp/B00CRZ2PRM/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_147_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RAM4G1GKFHXT2VYNM0EX)
I don't know how large the 0.188 roms+ CHD files are, but the 0.165 fullset was ~350 gigs. i suggested the above hd because it was cheaper to get a 1tb one than a 500gb one. kinda weird.
small sd card, the disc image is literallt 602 MB, so we don't need that large of one.
19" monitor is all we need (https://www.amazon.com/Dell-1907FPc-Rotating-Monitor-Silver/dp/B002XMQMQ4/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1502924215&sr=1-3&keywords=19+inch+lcd&refinements=p_n_size_browse-bin%3A2633649011%2Cp_36%3A1253504011)[link]
